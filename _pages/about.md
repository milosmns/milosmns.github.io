## To my visitors‚Ä¶

I write here about software, tech and tech organizations. _(for the most part)_

#### ü§î &nbsp; <font color="#F88">Why though</font>?

I like to share ideas through presentations and writing.

If you see something related to technology, I'll probably like it.
I am a software enthusiast, product developer, technical leader, speaker, event organizer, and avid skier.

My main interests are organizations, apps, cloud, electronics and smart devices.
I also often read or listen about innovation, computer science, and organizational management.

In my spare time, I (try to) travel with my family, speak at conferences, coach, and work on open-source projects.

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è &nbsp; Connect with me

You can find me on the most important social platforms using my usual handle:

```
  @ milosmns
```

*(or click the social buttons below)*

If you want to get in touch right now, use the [contact page](/contact).  
I will not respond to spam. However, if you just want to say **hi** for no particular reason and have a chat, send me an email to [`hi` (at this domain)](mailto:hi@milos.marinkovic.xyz).

#### üè¶ &nbsp; Sources and attribution

I try to use free audio, video and graphic resources, but I build a lot of those on my own too.
