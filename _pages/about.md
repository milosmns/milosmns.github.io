## To my visitors‚Ä¶

I write here about software, tech and tech organizations. _(for the most part)_

#### ü§î &nbsp; <font color="#F88">Why though</font>?

I like to share ideas through presentations and writing.

If you see something related to technology, I'll probably like it.
I am a software enthusiast, product developer, technical leader, speaker, event organizer, and avid skier.

My main interests are organizations, apps, cloud, electronics and smart devices.
I also often read or listen about innovation, computer science, and organizational management.

In my spare time, I (try to) travel with my family, speak at conferences, coach, and work on open-source projects.
