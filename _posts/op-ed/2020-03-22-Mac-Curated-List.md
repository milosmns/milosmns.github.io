## What is this?

To be clear, I'm not a productivity freak... but I do have a set of tools that I've grown accustomed to and without which I am (or feel) significantly less productive.

This post will be a subjective, up-to-date, and curated list of all the Mac tools I use on a daily basis, with some additional good finds worth trying.
