## What is this?

To start with‚Ä¶ I'm **not** a productivity freak (said every productivity freak ever). However, I do have a set of tools that I've grown accustomed to and really rely on. Without these tools, I *feel* significantly less productive ‚Äì whether that's real or just a perception.

This post is more of a guide for myself. It will be subjective, potentially outdated, or not as useful to you as it is to me. It's curated list of all the Mac tools I use, with some additional good new discoveries worth trying out.
