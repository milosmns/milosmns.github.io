### The <font color="#F88">Time Management</font> Series

This post is just one part of my [Time Management](/2022/11/01/Time-is-of-the-Essence) series. I really recommend you read the whole series if you have time, but I'll do my best to make this part self-contained.  
**Important disclaimers** are also included there.

## Zero Inbox

#### ü™¶ &nbsp; Learning from Google's Inbox

Remember the Google Inbox app? Back in 2015, it was new, fresh, clean and bold‚Ä¶ only to end up in [Google's product graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com) when it was [discontinued in 2019](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/here-lies-google-inbox-a-radical-rethink-of-how-email-should-work). Ex-Google engineers seem to have revived it with [Shortwave](https://shortwave.com), but I haven't gotten around to trying it out yet.

{: refdef}

Anyway, **Inbox** was perfect for me. It gave me a clear sense of what I still needed to do, and I was able to start my new Inbox experience by simply archiving everything I'd ever done!
**One pro-tip**: You can still [archive all messages in Gmail](https://www.alphr.com/archive-all-emails-gmail), just not as easily.

#### ü§î &nbsp; What was so good about Inbox?

The effect of clicking **"Done"**. I personally find it very satisfying to get things done and get them out of my sight. Does it matter how big the piece of work was? No, not at all. Even when archiving spam messages, clicking the "Done" button is very satisfying.

Which brings me to the topic of archiving email. **IN MY OPINION** there's really no reason not to archive emails (in Gmail, that basically just means moving them to the _All Mail_ folder). The emails aren't deleted, they're just in the archive -- you can still search them, you can still go through them chronologically if you want, you can still delete them, categorize them and mark them as spam or reply to them. I assume Google compresses the archive under the hood, but that's where the differences between your inbox folder and your archive end.

So <font color="#F88">what's the big deal</font> then?

#### 0Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; Is zero a positive number?

If all your emails are in the archive, your inbox is **empty**. If you work to try and keep it at zero, your inbox turns into a work **queue**. The emails come in, get processed, marked as done (archived), and you move on‚Ä¶ until you get the inbox level to zero. Many email clients now offer archiving features, and I can show you some examples from the tools I use.

#### ‚è∞ &nbsp; Decluttering and snoozing

Now if you think that Inbox Zero is a fetish or that it's just about the satisfaction of clicking "done", I have to disagree -- it's about organizing work without having to use TODO lists like Todoist, Trello, Tasks and others. And it's not even just about the inbox or emails. This applies to all things, everywhere. Getting your TODO list to zero is the ultimate goal! To better understand what I'm referring to, check out the rest of the posts in my Time Management series.

##### Filters

The first thing you should do is unsubscribe from all newsletters. There's a link in the footer of the email that asks you to secretly unsubscribe. However, there are things you can't unsubscribe from -- for such cases I use **email filters**. They're now available in most email clients and with most email providers; see an example below.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Filtering Emails](/images/posts/time-management-gmail-filters.png)
*Gmail Filters (Settings, then Filters)*
{: refdef}

##### Snoozing

If I don't have enough time (or I'm not motivated enough) to get things done, I've made it a rule to **decide immediately <font color="#F88">if</font>** and **<font color="#F88">when</font>** I'll get back to them. Building on the other ideas in this series‚Ä¶ I'm usually quite honest with myself about my existing commitments and am likely to decline new tasks. In those cases, I communicate it immediately and **archive** the email. Sometimes, however, I plan to come back to things -- and then I **<font color="#F88">snooze</font>** things for later. The simplest example of this is when I'm at the store (which takes less than 2 hours) and I can therefore delay responding for 2 hours. Most communication tools these days have the snooze feature built in, so I use it.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Android Snooze](/images/posts/time-management-android-snooze.png)
*Pro-tip: Snooze notifications from any app*
{: refdef}

My main argument here is to use the snooze feature instead of keeping things in the inbox, because the latter turns the inbox into a **black hole backlog**. Just get rid of things if you don't want to do them right away or at all. And yes, I apply the same policy to all my chats, messengers, emails and other communications, whether professional or personal -- all of it is at inbox zero.

##### SARA and Touch it once

The biggest decluttering hack I use is the **<font color="#F88">SARA</font>** policy.  
SARA stands for:

  - **<font color="#F88">S</font>nooze** -- Only if there's a better time in the future to get it done
  - **<font color="#F88">A</font>sk for Help** -- It's important to do it now, but I don't have time. Someone can help
  - **<font color="#F88">R</font>eject** -- There's no good time in the near future to get it done
  - **<font color="#F88">A</font>ct** -- Get it done immediately

I just made that up. But I really do one of those four actions on every incoming task, everywhere.

For everything else, I refer to the prioritization framework described elsewhere in this series. My most important principle is that I really tackle things as they come in, and only <font color="#F88">tackle them once</font>. I want them to disappear from my inbox. Most responses from me will be quick, but the other side may get stuck -- I try to anticipate such cases and don't click "Send and Archive", but **"Send and Snooze"** instead -- to remind me of the follow-up.

To "snooze" things in real life, I put things in front of me. Literally. For example, I put a letter I need to send on the door handle, or put the trash in the middle of the room‚Ä¶ Going back to the same principle -- don't put anything on hold indefinitely; do it now, give it to someone else, postpone it to a specific time, or reject it.

## Software help

As you've seen so far, it's hard to clean up your work inbox, especially if you only have one (black hole) backlog‚Ä¶ but luckily, there are plenty of software tools to help you organize. For my personal life, there's not much team or process selection -- it's mostly chaos and we're just supposed to adapt. üòÖ

Buy at work, I like to work in <font color="#F88">agile</font> and <font color="#F88">lean</font> teams. And by that I don't mean obsessively or blindly following agile implementations like Scrum or Kanban. To be clear: I've worked in well-organized Scrum and Kanban teams, but that's not what I mean when I say "agile" and "lean" here. I'm mainly referring to the dynamic nature of such organizations‚Ä¶ and this can be achieved through Scrum or Kanban (but doesn't have to be).

Let's briefly remind ourselves again what each term means.

##### [The Agile Manifesto &nbsp; ‚§¥Ô∏è](https://agilemanifesto.org)

  1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  4. Responding to change over following a plan

##### [What is Lean &nbsp; ‚§¥Ô∏è](https://www.lean.org/explore-lean/what-is-lean)  

  1. Lean is a way of thinking about creating needed value with fewer resources and waste
  2. It is a practice of continuous experimentation to achieve perfect value with zero waste
  3. Lean thinking and practice occur together
  4. Lean thinking always starts with the customer

**<font color="#F88">And that's really all it is</font>**.  
**Scrum** and **Kanban** are simply the two most popular methodologies [of dozens](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/pm-methodology/agile-methodologies) defined today.

#### üìù &nbsp; Organizational tools

In no particular order, I'll list some of the tools that most agile teams use today. To be clear, not all of these tools are useful and not all of them promote the agile/lean mindset. In fact, I believe some of the tools promote slowness and a less dynamic work style (e.g. JIRA). Behind others are simply decadent organizations that apply dark usability patterns to get you to use their tools (e.g. Microsoft Teams, Facebook Workplace). But most of them made it to my list because of their general popularity.

##### <font color="#F88">Raycast</font> &nbsp; ‚ö°Ô∏è

**[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)** gets a special mention, even though I've already mentioned it in my post on _[How to prepare a Mac for Engineering work ‚§¥Ô∏è](/2020/03/23/Preparing-Mac-Engineering)_. This tool replaces Spotlight on a Mac. It closes so many items from my work queue with just 2-3 keystrokes, it's crazy. Clipboard Managers, Google Translate, Homebrew, Spotify, formatters, encoders/decoders and many other tools are available as plugin downloads from their store.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Raycast Calendar](/images/posts/time-management-raycast-meetings.png)
*Calendar integration, one of my absolute favorites*
{: refdef}

When I organize my personal life, I add my work account as an invitee to all reminders and calendar appointments (doctor, embassy, cinema, etc.). I have such invitations automatically cloned into our family calendar, so that my wife can "benefit" (she says: üôÑ) from my organizational skills too -- that's how I don't miss anything and am always informed about personal and work events. It's all neatly integrated into Raycast and just a couple of keystrokes away!

##### Automation &nbsp; ü§ñ

Any engineer will tell you -- if you can automate something, invest time to automate it. The only thing you can do better is to remove it! üòÖ

> Never spend 10 minutes doing something manually when you can spend 3 days automating it!

> <cite>Every [10X Engineer](https://a16z.com/2014/07/30/the-happy-demise-of-the-10x-engineer) Ever</cite>

When we talk about automation, there are a lot of things you can do. At this point, I'd like to give a shout out to our friendly Slack bot, `GO`, who helps us with so many things around [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd) and process automation. Getting rid of tasks, remember? You'll have to write this code yourself, of course, but maybe you also have someone like [Tushar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tushar-nallan) who's willing to spend a lot of time on it to get it done right!

Here are some examples of what GO does for us.  
_(note: it's mostly about process automation)_

When this stuff is coming in a bot message, it allows cross-posting and additional communication if needed in the thread. So yes, just automate everything.

## In conclusion‚Ä¶

> Mastering something is not about doing 4000 things -- it‚Äôs about doing 12 things 4000 times

> <cite>[Chet Holmes](https://chetholmes.com/about-us)</cite>

And I think that's quite right. I think the overall theme of this post is to give some tips on how to reduce the burden as much as possible by thoughtfully organizing TODO lists, and how to get rid of tasks as quickly as possible. Focus on what matters, on those 12 things.

But, ironically, **the more you work on automating and getting rid of tasks quickly, the less visible your work becomes**. üò¨

That's pretty annoying if you're trying to showcase your accomplishments and/or share knowledge -- and it's one of the reasons I'm writing this article. I've already mentioned in other parts of my Time Management series how I track and share my work (a separate Discovery board, etc.)‚Ä¶ so below you'll find some really nice resources that have helped me put things in perspective.
